👋 Hi, I'm David Calonne, a 24-year-old French Front-End Developer.
🌱 I’m currently learning NodeJS to build more applications without needing to rely on a back-end developer.
💞️ I’m open to collaborating on projects because I truly love coding.
📫 JavaScript, TypeScript, Next.js, HTML, CSS (Less & Vanilla), and ReactJS.

I'm currently working on some personal projects that I’ll share here once they’re finished.
Feel free to contact me at david@dcalonne.fr or directly on GitHub.
